- [Code Explain](#code-explain)
components/parser.py: This file contains the definition of a parser class (MyParser) using the SLY library. It defines the grammar rules for parsing arithmetic expressions and builds a parse tree.

components/lexica.py: This file contains the definition of a lexer class (MyLexer) using the SLY library. It defines the rules for tokenizing input strings into tokens like numbers, operators, parentheses, etc.

parser.out: This file is an output file generated by the parser. It typically contains debugging information such as the states and transitions of the parser's finite state machine.

main.py: This file contains the main logic for the calculator application. It integrates the parser and lexer to parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions entered by the user. It also handles the GUI using PyQt6.

components/main.ui: This file is a user interface file. It defines the layout and design of the calculator GUI, including buttons, labels, and input/output fields.

components/calculator_logic.py: This file contains the logic for evaluating arithmetic expressions. It defines functions for performing arithmetic operations like addition, multiplication, etc. This logic is used by the parser to evaluate expressions and produce results and postfix and prefix expression.
